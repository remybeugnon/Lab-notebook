# Lab-notebook
 R based notebook to report your daily progress

# Introduction

Using the R package bookdown I built a small project compiling daily logs of my work together with description and schedule of my projects. The lab book was built using the bookdown R package (Xie, 2021) to easily integrate daily notes, figures and code chunks. Using blogdown allows for a high flexibility in the format, and working with several collaborators once the notebook is uploaded on GitHub (or GitLab).

Details and additional options on [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/).

# Tips

-   RStudio implemented a visual editor for Rmarkdown which allows you to write your logs like a Word document ([Tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/))

-   I would recommend to start the Notebook every year as the number of logs and figures in the folder can increase quite quickly.

-   Label your figures like "yyyy-mm-dd-title.png" if you want to have a chance to find them again later.
